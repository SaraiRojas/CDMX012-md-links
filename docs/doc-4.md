## 1. Overview

This project consists of a web application that allows users to validate a credit card number using Luhn algorithm. A message is displayed on screen when the card number is valid or not, once the card number is validated, numbers except for the last four digits are masked. Only numbers between 13 to 18 characters are allowed, since cards numbers length falls into this range.
